## 🧭 Abstract

**Affinari** introduces a transparent, schema-driven framework for contextual alignment and doppelganger matching across any domain involving human or system preferences.  
Rather than inferring intent through opaque machine learning, Affinari makes alignment *explicit*: each entity declares a structured set of traits (scalars, tags, and categoricals) which are compared deterministically using weighted Manhattan distance and cosine similarity.  

This produces explainable “fit” scores that reveal *why* a match occurs, rather than obscuring it.  
The method generalises across domains — from hospitality and medicine to finance and education — forming a portable foundation for interpretable, alignment-based AI systems.

## 🧮 Method Summary

- **Schema Layer:** Each domain defines its own JSON schema of traits (scalar, tag, categorical).  
- **Matching Engine:** Computes weighted Manhattan distance for alignment scores; optional cosine layer for peer or feedback similarity.  
- **Doppelganger Logic:** Identifies and propagates preferences via similar evaluators, enabling “people-like-you” recommendations.  
- **Transparency Principle:** All weights, metrics, and schema fields are user-visible and interpretable.
