# Monetisation Models (Aligned by Domain)

- **Aligned PPC (sponsored placement)** — for high‑volume retail/services. Sponsor lift is bounded and never overrides fit.
- **Licensing / subscription** — for deep, relationship domains (hospitality, education, clinical).
- **Conversion fee via Affinari Gateway** — for marketplace merchants (e.g., Etsy‑style): pay on successful conversions.

See RFC‑0005 (Informative) for ethics and ranking constraints.
