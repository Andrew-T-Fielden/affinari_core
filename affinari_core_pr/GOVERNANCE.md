# Affinari Governance (Lightweight)

- **Spec ownership**: This repository is the canonical Affinari Method spec.
- **Changes**: Proposed via RFCs in `/RFC`. Open a PR with a new `RFC-XXXX.md`.
- **Normative vs Informative**: Each RFC must mark its sections clearly.
- **Versioning**: SemVer for spec; breaking spec changes = MAJOR bump.
- **Stewards**: Initially maintained by Andrew T. Fielden with invited collaborators.
